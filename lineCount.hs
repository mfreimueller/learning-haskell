    -- We create a tuple (I think) containing either an exception on the left

-- naive version:

-- countLines :: String -> Integer

-- -- 
-- countLines content = do
--     let totalLines = lines content
--     listLength totalLines
--     where 
--         listLength :: [String] -> Integer
--         listLength[] = 0

-- This is how you would iterate over a list and count its elements
-- (given that you don't use the built-in `length` function).
-- Basically you cut away the head with each recursive step
-- and increment by 1 each time:
--         listLength (x:xs) = 1 + listLength xs

-- main :: IO ()
-- main = do
--     putStrLn "Enter path to file to count its lines: "
--     path <- getLine

--     content <- readFile path

--     let lines = countLines content

-- You could use parentheses. More Haskell-native would be using $, probably
--     putStrLn ("Total number of lines: " ++ show lines)
